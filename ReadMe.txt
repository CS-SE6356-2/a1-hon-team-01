To implement a certain card game from this framework, you will need to create classes for your UIController, GameController, and a Card class (if the StandardCard isn’t used). 

StandardCard represents the basic 52-card deck that most games utilize. 

The GameController will provide numbers for the amount of teams, decks per person, decks on the board et cetera. 
GameController will control how the game progresses and user input is handled. 

The UIController will control how the game looks, when things are drawn, how things react to being clicked or buttons pressed et cetera. 

As this framework is improved upon, more updates will be made to this file in order to explain how to utilize the changes.
